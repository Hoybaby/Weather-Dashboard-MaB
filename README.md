# Weather-Dashboard-MaB

<h1>Objective: To create a Weather Dashboard with Javascript</h1>
    <p>Developers are often tasked to obtain data from a API. They need to properly
    perform aJax calls and use the APIs correctly. Calling API's information is very important in the work field</p>
    <p> It is very important to find a good api that has good documentation. If there is problems that occur with the API, it can be difficult for the team to figure out the problem without good and clear documentation.

<h3>Step by StepProcess</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In order to call the API, first make a function name that is going to target the API.</li>
        <li>Create an ajax call with $.ajax then display the type, url with your key, and the dataType</li>
        <li> After the critera above is met, developer than needs to use a .then(function> to place the information into however the developer wants. In this case, a card.</li>
        <li>In order to call the information into the card, developer needs to look how to retrieve the object that was retrieved from the API and see the path location of that object</li>
        <li>This information can be put into paragraph tags then appended to the card we created.</li>
        <li>Once the single day forecast, was done, the same process would take place for the 5 day forcast and UV index.</li>
        <li>The next thing was local storage which means we have to store when the cities were search by inputing the search value into an array then later getting that name with a getItem and place it into a button.</li>
    </ol>
